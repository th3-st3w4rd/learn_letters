# learn_letters
This is a little CLI game to help kids practice reading capital/lowercase letter, symbols,
numbers, and get them used to a keyboard. This game is NOT meant for kids to play by themselves, because of it's technical implimentation...but it's really helpful for techy parents, family, or caregivers to sit down and help thier kids figure out how to recognize and match letters.

The game also keeps track of how many correct and incorrect answers were given. Maybe parents
could relate prizes to how many attempts the child tried.
